* Mac OS
* Linux

## Getting Started

### Installing Java
<p align="justify">
Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) is only a requirement for developers. Users who plan to solely use the program (run the pre-built JAR file) are only required to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The minimum compiler compliance is Java 8, meaning that systems with installations of Java 1.8 and above can run the JAR. Simply install the version of your choice from the link above and run the installer.

### Building OpenCV
<p align="justify">
<a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> is required for both developers and users in order to run this code. Please read the tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/opencv-java/opencv-java-tutorials/blob/master/docs/source/01-installing-opencv-for-java.rst">Installing OpenCV for Java</a> in order to correctly build OpenCV for your operating system.
